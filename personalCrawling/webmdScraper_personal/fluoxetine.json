{"Drug name": "fluoxetine oral", "long description": "NOT FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE PANIC ATTACKS.\n\nI put my reason for taking this medication as depression but it was actually anxiety. I have medication anxiety in addition to a mild panic disorder (1-2 panic attacks a month) at the time, and i say at the time because taking this medication caused my mild panic disorder to become a full-blown panic disorder (3-4 panic attacks per week that were way more intense than before) after taking the first and only dose i ever took.\n\nin addition to my GAD & panic disorder, i have medication anxiety. i had tried lexapro before this medication & got just about every side effect possible after the first dose which made my medication anxiety worse. to deal with the anxiety of trying this medication for the first time, i got the smallest dose possible, and CUT IT IN HALF. \n\nabout 45 minutes after taking it i was hit with a sickening wave of anxiety that caused the longest lasting anxiety attack i\u2019ve ever had, about 3 hours. i threw up multiple times and was completely unable to get food down. the anxiety exhausted me until i could nap and that would help to reset me for awhile, but eventually i would have another anxiety attack once i woke up. this went on for 3 days & i had extremely heightened anxiety for weeks afterward where i struggled to even go on car rides without having a panic attack (i found out later that fluoxetine can last up to a month in your system after you take it). i started to feel somewhat normal after that, but the damage on my psyche was done & i now understood i was not safe from these horrible anxiety attacks in my own room, hence now having a full-blown panic disorder. \n\ni definitely think that my existing anxiety enhanced the side effects of this medication, but the medication definitely played a significant part in it because im on a different medication now & didn\u2019t have nearly the same effects despite having more anxiety about taking it.\n\ni purposely avoided looking at side effects before i tried it to avoid my anxiety creating the side effects i read, but i did find out heightened anxiety is a side effect of this medication after recovering from trying it. so unbelievably not worth it if you are wanting something to help with panic attacks: talk to your doctor about buspirone or Buspar if you have medication anxiety & panic attacks, steer VERY clear of this horrible medication."},
{"Drug name": "fluoxetine oral", "long description": "I took this for a few weeks about 20 years ago, and it was the worst experience in my life. I was suffering with depression (still am), and was prescribed this drug to help. Within 2 weeks of taking it, it unlocked what I can best describe as a darker version of myself. Less caring, rough and menacing. I felt like I was watching myself do things that I couldn\u2019t stop or control.\n\nOne particular incident made me come off the tablets immediately because I did not like the person Fluoxetine had turned me into. It put me off trying other antidepressants for 20 years. (I have just started taking a different one)\n\nSo while I am in the 45-54 bracket now, I was in the 19-24 bracket back then. "},

{"Drug name": "fluoxetine oral", "long description": "This is going to be a long post, but I really hope that anyone thinking about taking this medication who is scared to start will read it the whole way through.  I am a therapist, and I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and some OCD tendencies, like listing, checking, and intense intrusive thoughts about harm, health, and safety.  I have had anxiety since as early as I can remember but it wasn\u2019t until my 20s that it really started to interfere with my life.  Even as a therapist I had stigma about taking meds, and fears that it would dull my personality, or dull my creativity, or dull the positive emotions I feel.  I was scared it would fundamentally change me and my sensitivities to life, which can be a source of pain but also a source of joy.    I started on 10mg, and had a hard time for a month, I experienced insomnia, intense moments of anxiety, fogginess, fatigue, and mild dizziness.  Then I had a few great weeks on 10mg.  I decided to up the dose to 20mg, and I actually experienced a hard time for about 5 weeks while I adjusted.  I kept wanting to throw in the towel and go back to 10mg but something kept me waiting to see if things would feel better.  During the five weeks adjusting to 20mg I experienced fogginess, fatigue, dizziness, mild disorientation, and anxiety.  I really just didn\u2019t feel like myself and it was scary and really hard.  After 5 weeks everything changed.    I now feel like I have been given a huge gift, kind of like I have been given a version of my life I didn\u2019t know I could have.  I can lay on the couch and feel safe in my body and safe in my mind instead of worrying what catastrophe could be lurking around the corner.  I can go to sleep at night excited to sleep instead of fearing it will be an insomnia night.  I can turn off the stove and check that it is off once instead of keeping going back to check over and over while my body gets all tight with anxiety.  I can hug my people and animals I love without immediately feeling a pang of anticipatory grief that one day I will lose them.  I can lay on my deck and look at the sky and trees and feel the breeze on my face and feel grateful for my life, instead of immediately looking for a problem or thinking about a worst case scenario situation that could rob me of my happiness and contentment.    I am someone who is deeply committed to doing my own inner work and I have worked for years and years on my head.  I have journaled, I have become a therapist, I have been in therapy for years, I have learned to meditate, I have done anxiety workbooks, read self help books, learned about the mind body connection, learned how to really take care of myself from resting, to exercising, to learning yoga etc, taken courses on anxiety, and the list could go on and on.  I didn\u2019t want that to stop on Prozac, and that was one my fears about taking this medication.  I did not want to completely lose the highs and lows of life, I wanted to keep doing my inner work, but I also did not want to have to work so hard just to function sometimes.  I can say now that Prozac does not diminish my inner work at all, instead it facilitates it.  I still see my habitual response to a peaceful moment is to look for a problem, but now I have some distance on that pattern and I can see it without immediately getting lost in fear thoughts.  The distance allows me to work with fear thoughts rather than just getting hooked.  This medication allows me to notice when I am happy and safe, and trust those moments and enjoy them, without fear crashing in and ruining it.  I have spent so much of my life thinking about darkness, pain, and fear.  This medication has allowed me to notice peace, happiness, and contentment, and connect to the love in my life without the fear of loss ruining a moment.    I still feel all the subtle changes in moods and emotions that I always did, but when it is around something irrational I can see what is happening in my mind and work with it, rather than getting swall"},

{"Drug name": "fluoxetine oral", "long description": "So when we were put into lockdown round 2 in England I was working on my own in the office, overtime, through breaks, hour train and back it was highly stressful especially at 20 and other factors in my personal life led to a massive mental breakdown. I had depression, ocd and anxiety in the past quite badly as a teen so I thought if I could get myself out of that I could get myself out of anything my brain challenged me to. Not the case. This time it hit me like a tonne of bricks. Overnight I went from a normal happy, all though stressed individual to an absolute wreck. I eat less then 100 calories a day on the days I could get something down. Physically shaking from the second I woke up to the second I went to sleep I was written out of work by my dr. On the days I didn\u2019t have nightmares I\u2019d wake up in the early morning heart racing body shaking and no matter what I tried it did not stop. Meditation, herbal remedies, teas, video therapy\u2026nothing. I was adamant I didn\u2019t want to take any medication as all the times in the past I had got through it on my own and so I didn\u2019t want to give in but after only a month of the same intrusive thoughts, racing heart, nausea that couldn\u2019t be stopped I reluctantly gave in. Best decision I ever made I truly believe I would still be ill if I hadn\u2019t taken anything. I remember going through this and other review websites for hours on end reading good reviews wishing this was all I needed. After 2 weeks I had seen a tiny amount of improvement however I had been told by family members who take this medication they felt much better after 2 weeks so I was at a point wondering if it would work. It does. after 2 weeks my heart wasn\u2019t pounding out of my chest. After 4 the intrusive thoughts started to quieten and now I don\u2019t hear them at all. I know you\u2019re thinking 4 weeks! I can\u2019t live like this for that long but you can and you will nothing lasts forever and this too shall pass!"},

Didn't help much for the 2 weeks I used it. I just upped my dose to 40mg and am going to ride this out for a month or so to give it time to fully get into my system. I have a feeling that this might be my necessary dose for a while.

{"Drug name": "Prozac oral", "long description": "Prozac has been a literal life saver for me. I've dealt with anxiety and depression since I was a small child. In about 2000 I started having panic attacks and my doctor prescribed me Klonopin. It helped, of course, but I didn't like taking something I could become addicted to, so I stopped it in 2009. For a couple years everything was fine, but then the panic attacks came back even worse than before. I developed agoraphobia and by 2015 I was in a near constant state of panic and became suicidal. Finally, I was able to make it to my doctor (the 20 minute drive was a sheer living hell). I broke down in his office and told him that I couldn't keep living like this. He prescribed me Prozac and BuSpar. I was skeptical of whether it would work or not, but I had to do something about my severe panic attacks. The BuSpar helped a bit while the Prozac took effect. I am now on 60mg per day of Prozac and 30mg per day of BuSpar and it has given me my life back. I still deal with low-grade anxiety, but the panic attacks are gone. I can shower and cook and drive without being thrown into panic. I know we all react differently to medications and our bodies are all different, but I'd recommend that anyone with severe panic attacks give it a go.

I have been dealing with a lot of stressful things in my life over the past few years (and even more here recently), but this has definitely helped me tremendously. The only negative side effect I have experienced thus far with Fluoxetine is losing some sexual desire. This was/is a problem for me because my wife and I are currently trying to conceive. I have never had a problem in this department and actually I would say I had more desire when it comes to sex than most others. Just here recently I think I am starting to get back to normal a little bit in that department. I feel like my sexual desire may be coming back to me like it was before getting on this medication.

{"Drug name": "fluoxetine oral", "long description": "Periodic intense life stresses over time led to PTSD and anxiety, which led to panic attacks that began increasing with frequency to the point that it was almost nightly. I would fear a panick attack and that would set off a panick attack. By this time I thought that if this couldn't be remedied I thought about suicide. It was many months of horror and grimness and I was far from my normal self. Doc tried me on Buspar (Busparone). Only helped about 30%. Then tried me on 10mg of Fluoxetine and it was working very well even within a few days. I've been on it 8 months and it's been an ABSOLUTE MIRACLE! Also with the panick I was having all kinds of gastrointestinal problems. I saw a specialist for that. Lo and behold, between my two docs, I learned that I was low on seratonin, which is not only in the brain but also (normally) in abundance in the intestines. So both \"illnesses\" were indicating low seratonin. Both illnesses went away with Fluoxetine. I've also had a lifelong struggle with excessive daytime sleepiness, or being in a non-motivated, non-functional state akin to alpha meditation level; this is a part of my A.D.D. I still had an issue with this after being on fluoxetine, so I went back on Concerta (long-acting Ritalin) 18mg (lowest dose) taken in the morning, and I have REALLY returned to my real self: go getter, doer, creative again, motivated, upbeat, etc. Because the Concerta keeps me at a normal, alert level during the day, I now sleep like a baby at night. The Concerta has not had any negative effect towards anxiety either, so I've been on top of the world, and I don't fear the future any more.  In fact, in the last few months, I've been the mediator in a very difficult family situation, and have been so mellow and yet so effective at it (unlike my past anxietal response to my family's issues), way better than even before my PTSD. I thank God for these medications every day!  And so does my husband, kids and grandkids!"},

{"Drug name": "fluoxetine oral", "long description": "I began suffering from depression and anxiety during college, and it affected my ability to concentrate, sometimes even to get out of bed in the morning.  So before I decided to pursue my graduate degree, I knew that I would have to do something.  I talked to the doctor and she put me on a 10mg dose (which didn't do much, but allowed me to see if I could tolerate the medication and ease into taking an antidepressant).  After a couple weeks we stepped it up to the 20mg dose, and I wish that I had started this medication years ago!  The dose is low enough that I've recognized no side effects other than some trouble falling asleep during the first few weeks that I took the medication.  I sleep fine now, and all the problems with anxiety and depression are so much better.  I have to take it with food, though, or I get a bit of reflux."},

Still had the underlying depression (seems I can't get away from it).  So my doc switched me to 40 mg/day of fluoxetine.  The first two weeks on the higher dosage were okay, but then came the pms - the higher dosage actually exacerbated the symptoms and made them worse than when I was on the citalopram.  I was agitated, jumpy, nervous, crabby, easily angered, couldn't think straight - scary.

I'm able to be able to largely drown out my anxious thoughts with music or other ways of getting it off my mind. I still have my anxious thoughts though, because fighting social anxiety takes a long time. I still get upset easily though, and mad sometimes but even some of that is starting to improve a little.

{"Drug name": "fluoxetine oral", "long description": "I wrote a review 5 months ago, and was very pleased.  Today I'm back re-reading comments to see if others have some of the annoying symptoms I currently deal with.  Joint pain, morning headaches, a 25 pound weight gain and vaginal inflammation. I'm only on 10 mg, and don't feel that depressed, but having none of my clothes fit and just going from size 12 to 16, makes me fearful of where I'm going to go from here.  I'd rather be thin and depressed and look good in my clothes than be heavy and self conscious.  I'm going off the meds for now to lose the weight. I don't remember what other anti depressant made me gain weight, but I was in this same boat 2 years ago, and the weight came off quickly once I stopped the med.  Perhaps I'll just exercise a lot and hope the endorphins will kick in and soothe the depression.  I'll probably be writing again in 3 months saying I'm going back on the med, but for now I just want to lose this weight!  "},

So today, I decided to not take it.  And you know what? I felt that attraction to girls come back, I even felt happier, easier to talk to my friends, just generally better, as if I never had depression or anxiety, although I can still feel some of my social anxiety.

I started on 20mg and eventually cut back to 10mg. I have taken Sarafem for almost 10 years. (I went off it only when I was expecting my third son.) Negative side effects were some weight gain and decreased libido, which is why I cut back to 10 mg and noticed some improvement. I do find it's harder to lose weight than before, so I exercise more and eat healthy most of the time.  I openly speak with others about my success with fluoxetine, as I think that meds to treat mental health sometimes get a bad rap. It \"smooths out my rough edges\"...

My GYN suggested non generic stating it may contain purer ingredients, but $390 for 30 days w/insurance is not in the budget.

My doctor have me fluoxetine and I have been taking it everyday, soon I was feeling better and able to function in everyday life. now I feel so much better.

{"Drug name": "fluoxetine oral", "long description": "To begin with, it seems that I have been going through phases of depression for over 10 years since my mother became ill and I was her caregiver. Nonetheless, I never realized how strong the depression had a hold of my life and I simply excused the symptoms, believing that it would pass. Overtime, I noticed that I was unable to regain management over basic living functions, such as; paying bills, sleeping, exercising, regular house cleaning, etc. Now, I have recently shared more with my physician and he's determined that the sum of my problems originates from long-term depression combined with anxiety. It may seem premature; however, he prescribed me Fluoxetine and in only 3-days, I see a difference in my behavior. I'm beginning to care about and focus more on personal important matters. The only side-effect, thus far, are vivid dreams, nothing serious.  I recommend this medication as a starter treatment if medically possible. "},

My problems began after a car accident (got rear ended) 6 years ago, when I began having back pain that still has not resolved, even after seeing some of the best physical therapists available and faithfully doing the exercises again and again.  I finally accepted that I would probably never be better and always be sad and in pain.  Even though the pain is not better, I am happy at least for a bit every day.  Doing exercise seems like a good idea again, even though it won't make me better, it will keep me from getting worse.

{"Drug name": "fluoxetine oral", "long description": "This is a follow up review for Celexa from July 2010, but I am currently on fluoxetine and review it further down. I took generic Celexa for 9-10 months. I gained about 10 pounds and was sleeping excessively. I would sleep 8 hours each night and still felt like I needed a nap every day. I went off this medicine to try ibuprpion to help me quit smoking. That was a failure-felt like a witch and it wasn't very effective at helping me stop smoking. After I went off ibupropion, I tried not taking any medicine, but rather supplements. I took 5HTP (for depression) and valerian root for anxiety for about a month. It helped a little, but not like AD medication. So I told my doctor I wanted something that made me feel like Celexa (happy, no worries, emotionally awesome), but that wouldn't make me hungry and sleepy all the time. She prescribed generic prozac which I've been taking for a little over a month. I really like it so far-normal appetitie, sleeping ok, and feel good emotionally. I have noticed a bit of vaginal tenderness/inflammation, but I presume that is happening due to decreased frequency of sex. Other reviewers of generic prozac have said they've noticed it as well. As with Celexa, my libido has decreased, but that has actually helped since my partner has a weaker than libido than I did before depression hit. Overall, I'm very satisfied with generic prozac.

Each time hoping for the famous results and instead, each time getting nothing except fatigue, complete loss of libido, weight gain, and only a slight change in mood for the better, on a few non PMDD days; one or two days of my two week PMDD. I have depression and it gets so bad before my period. My weight fluctuates 10-15 lbs before my period. My mood swings are scary. I have cramps for a week. So in a nut shell, I am a nut. In all seriousness, I have depression worsened by PMDD or PMDD worsened by depression. Either way, the Doctors always go back to \"Let's just try adding some Prozac again, one more time.\" I think there are two or three days of the month, not during my PMDD time, I think I feel better. However, the rest of the month is not worth it. Tired and sexless? Those are the two best ways to make a married depressed and hormonal mother of two, in her 30's, give up all together! I did see a small difference in cramps too. If it did not wreck my libido, I would stay on it for longer than the three months I usually give it, to see if the effects would increase and perhaps I could see better overall longterm benefits."},

I really wish I would have been brave enough years before to admit that I needed some help...it saddens me to think of the \"living\" that I lost out on in my youth.    I took it religiously for the first year, and then developed some sort of itchy body rash.  Two biopsies could not determine the cause.  After 6 months the rash went away.  Near the end of the first year of 20-30mg I was frustrated that I even had to take anything, and felt like it wasn't doing anything for me anymore.  I quit cold turkey with no side effects, but noticed after several months that I was reverting back to my mean self.  Finally, June of this year I got back on at 40mg.  It started helping right away, but now my body is once again consumed with this rash.  My skin constantly feels like it is crawling, and I wake myself at night scratching, that is when I am fortunate enough to fall asleep.  I haven't seen where anyone else has reported this side effect, but I can't trace it to anything but the Prozac.  I haven't taken a pill in 3 days, and the swelling in the bumps is going down, and while there is still an itch, it isn't as extreme as it was.

I have had depression on and off for probably 6-8 years or so (I am now 24). I've tried Lexapro, Wellbutrin, and another anti-depression medicine, but Fluoxetine seems to be helping me the best. Some of the other medications actually made things worse for me. I have been dealing with a lot of stressful things in my life over the past few years (and even more here recently), but this has definitely helped me tremendously. The only negative side effect I have experienced thus far with Fluoxetine is losing some sexual desire. This was/is a problem for me because my wife and I are currently trying to conceive. I have never had a problem in this department and actually I would say I had more desire when it comes to sex than most others. Just here recently I think I am starting to get back to normal a little bit in that department. I feel like my sexual desire may be coming back to me like it was before getting on this medication. Overall, I really like Fluoxetine and I think it's worth a shot if you are experiencing depression."},

I know I have taken many of them but prozac worked best. I have noticed through my experience and reading up on it that some work well for people but not others, so even though this worked well for me it might not for you.  DON'T expect a miracle from anti depressants they work gradually and you might not know it. Others will notice a difference in you more than you do.  "},
{"Drug name": "Prozac oral", "long description": "After taking Prozac for many years at 60 Mgs daily, my wife was diagnosed with stage IV Lymphoma Feb. 14, 2007. Our life has been a living hell since then. Many Chemo. tratments, hospital stays, a stem cell transplant and nothing has helped. I did some research on the medications my wife was taking prior to the cancer. I went to Eli Lilly's web site and researched the side effects of Prozac. One of the side effects of a high dose is the inflamation of the lympnodes which can lead to Lymphoma cancer. I lowered the dose my wife now takes to 40 MG a day. We can not stop the Prozac now because of this horrible cancer and the depression involved. We are a young retired couple living a life of hell, I feel because of Prozac.

{"Drug name": "Prozac oral", "long description": "Before using Prozac, I experienced a range of emotions between severe depression to feeling down and foggy. I also thought I had anxiety which was severe enough to cause shaking and most of the time just felt like constant static. I've been taking 20 mg generic Prozac for 10 months now and friends & family & I have noticed a very positive difference. For a time, I thought it was becoming less effective but my Psychiatrist suggested a Cognitive Therapy class. The combination of Prozac, 1-on-1 Therapy, group therapy, and the Cognitive Therapy class have each contributed to a significant reduction in my symptoms. I think it is normal to have positive and negative feelings when reacting to normal events in my life and that continues to happen ALTHOUGH the times when I get down about something do not last for extended periods of time like they used to and I don't get as severely depressed as before. I can still feel sadness about things but it's not the unreasonable \"crying for no reason\" that I used to experience. I consider Prozac one of many tools that my Psychiatrist has given me. I feel that it's the combination of the Prozac and the different forms of therapy that have eased my symptoms. Additionally, maintaining my weight and health and energy levels are important to me and none of these have been affected by taking Prozac. Now, instead of feeling depressed or anxious, I feel more positive,  clear-headed, and static-free. "},

I have been on MANY medications for Treatment Refractory Depression and, this has been my life saver. I tried it many years ago, and became very agitated / akathesiastic at only 10 mg., so, when it was suggested to me in replacement of Imipramine during a recent life crises I was hesitant, but figured I had nothing to lose at that point. I am so happy that I did. I have my life back.    I also take 70 mg. of Vyvanse for A.D.D. in the morning, and have noticed that Prozac really helps to even out the stimulant mood variations (I used to take Adderall which made me go up and down alot), and I have noticed that Prozac along with a stimulant makes the stimulant effect noticeably less mood-altering. I feel less \"Up\" from the stimlant, but also don't feel it can bring me as \"down\". To the point where the only difference I can see is that, when the Vyvanse isn't in me, I am just much less organized but my emotional world is not much different.     I also take Trazadone, 50 mg. per night for bed as Prozac makes me noticeably prone to fatigue during the days and insomnia often. This is a great medication for regulating circadian rythems.

{"Drug name": "Prozac oral", "long description": "I began taking Prozac many years ago following the death of my father by suicide. It helped, and I was later able to taper off and then quit. I resumed Prozac during a painful divorce and again got better and felt able to discontinue the drug after a time. Each time I remained off the drug for an extended period, however, my depression reoccured regardless of my current life circumstances. Currently, I have been on Prozac for about three years. I am perimenopausal and believe it is the only thing that keeps me from feeling the severe mood swings that are so common with the hormone fluctuations associated with menopause. I also attribute Prozac with saving my life as it has allowed me to function more normally than when I have not been taking it. There were many times I felt like giving up prior to taking this drug. Now, I can't imagine not living every day to the fullest. This is my experience but I would encourage people who try this drug to stick with it for awhile if the side effects are not too severe. For I believe, it is the long-term effects of the medicine that are so beneficial. I also take a small dosage of Trazadone at night as a sleep aid and take it and the Prozac only before bedtime.

About a week into taking my meds I realized I was having incredibly weird dreams, but not normal weird dreams; really off the wall; who dreams this kind of stuff, dreams. My dreams are more vivid and they are so out of this world that I actually remember them enough to be able to tell someone about them in detail! Even the normal nightmarish dreams are not really scary, my dreams are pretty comical! I am in my 3rd month and I don\u2019t really feel a change so my doctor prescribed me 40mg. I was very scared to take this medication for the first time, my doctor told me not to go to WebMd and read the reviews of this drug. As soon as I got home I went to this website, but the reviews proved my doctor right. He told me everyone reacts differently to this medication and to not scare myself into a panic attack. Sometimes it can be hard to find someone who understands what you are going thru unless they are going thru the same thing. I find it comforting to talk to people who have my condition because we are all able to relate to one another and the biggest thing is that we have sympathy for one another and not empathy. Our doctors and psychiatrists can only tell us what to take and listen, but they truly do not know how it feels to have your heart beat so fast that you can actually feel it, or when your body begins to shake uncontrollably; when your throat feels like it is closing up, you just want to get out of your own skin because you truly do not know what to do! This is an awful feeling, and to have someone to tell you to just calm down and breathe makes it even worse because your mind is so powerful it won\u2019t let you.

I tried Prozac again during those years but it was not effective. Finally last year I was diagnosed correctly with bipolar 1. The only other drug which has kept me alive has been the patch Emsam. I have been hospitalized 3 times and in desperation finally agreed to ECT last fall. Even that only relieved the depression a bit for only 2 months. I am grateful the Prozac worked as long as it did.

I was put on Prozac weekly and it was life transforming! I lost the 45 pounds I had gained, the mood swings stopped, I was still able to \"feel\"! I stayed on this medication for approximately a year and a half and when I went off it, I was able to simply stop taking it, no weaning!

{"Drug name": "Prozac oral", "long description": "I was diagnosed with major depression at age 17 and have been taking antidepressants for the past 12 years. When I first started taking Prozac and had fantastic results --- depression symptoms decreased, no more suicidal thoughts, could actually get out of bed.  I started out at 20 mg and my doctor eventually increased my dosage to 40 mg.  This dosage worked fine for about two years.  Then I started to have signficant worsening of my depression symptoms.  The doctor then added Elavil in addition to Prozac.  Also tried Pamelor with the Prozac - both worked very well, but fatigue was extreme (and side effects were horrible). I don't mind mild side effects if it means the depression is gone.  I tried Remeron, Wellbutrin, and Celexa before returning to Prozac.  None of these worked as well as Prozac had initially.  I went back to 40 mg Prozac and did well.  My dosage was eventually decreased to 20 mg which I have been on for about 8 years.  My depression symptoms have been well-controlled with this \"maintenance dose\".  I have been having more symptoms the past few months.  My doctor wants me to try Pristiq (which I will start tomorrow).  Overall, Prozac worked wonders when is was working.  I definitely developed a tolerance to this medication over time.  Side effects were pretty mild.  I definitely sweat more than most people and I have experienced some sexual side effects.  Overall, this drug saved my life but lost its effectiveness over time.  I wish it still worked as well for me as it did initially.  Definitely worth a try.    "},

At work I have noticed that I am in a daze, I go through the motions but can't recall what I just did. At first I noticed an increase in  sexual arousal, which caused me some concern, however it is very hard to have an orgasm.

{"Drug name": "Prozac oral", "long description": "I was prescribed 10mg once a day at my appointment last week, the same does I was on when I took several years ago. Doctors seem to find this the treatment of choice for those of us who suffer from chronic pain. Chronic pain is enough to trigger severe depression in anyone. I planed to go out this weekend and have a few drinks because you can\u2019t mix Prozac or the other medication I need to take for pain with alcohol, alcohol is a depressant so that\u2019s done and my plan was to start Prozac on Monday but I took my first does at 2:30 a.m., Sunday because I can\u2019t sleep (anxiety) I would like to go to bed. Prozac will make you sleepy; once your body is fully adjusted that sleepy feeling will pass. Take it at the same time every day; if the sleepy feeling is a problem take it at night before bed. I\u2019m taking my second dose at 8:00 p.m. tonight so I can sleep and I will stay on that schedule. I don\u2019t know why some people report weight gain and others loss, I think it\u2019s the difference in how depression effects different people. In my case I warned my friends and family that I was starting this medication and that I will drop about 10 lbs in the first month. That\u2019s what happened the first time I took it; I didn\u2019t want anyone to worry. I am already small and it\u2019ll be quite noticeable. I never had side effects before but still told my friends and family what could happen. I have a great support system and they will watch me closely for red flag side effects while I get adjusted. Prozac takes a few weeks before the full effects are felt even if you start feeling the benefits right away. If you can\u2019t stay on this medication for the first month then you haven\u2019t given it a chance. If you are having problems, talk with your doctor, they may need to adjust the dosage; if you can\u2019t talk with your doctor about your concerns then you have the wrong doctor, find one you can talk to. And what ever you do don\u2019t just stop taking it; you have to wean yourself off of it. I\u2019ll be back in a month "},

I am in the process of seeing a neurologist to make sure that there is nothing else going on and if not then I will have to try a different medicene.

{"Drug name": "Prozac oral", "long description": "I was suicidal and depressed, and this did nothing but take away my energy to do any harm to myself. In fact, I was still depressed, and gained 35 pounds. I was in a terrible fog, and felt even more depressed, just less motivated. I felt like a tranquilized animal. Which now, years later I discovered the doctor had medicated me very wrongly, and treated me falsely all along. He did not answer my questions about the drug and would just increase the dosage when I begged for answers. I left his 'care' after 3 years of being prescribed a crap drug. Thank God for second opinions, otherwise I would have been stuck in depression longer. She adjusted my care. I don't know if THAT is effective in a review, but I will report that any extreme exercise regiment or diet I was put on did nothing. Prozac keeps the 35 lbs. of extra weight on you until you are weaned off of it. Then, like magic I lost all that weight. "},

Xanax and Prozac cancelled the Dexedrine (even at 15mg ER). I am currently taking generic Prozac 20mg (one daily), generic Dexedrine 10mg ER (3x daily), and generic Xanax (No more than 1.25 mg 2-3x daily)and it has made a WORLD of diffrence. I am focused, anxiety well under control, barely notice Prozac, and the Dexedrine is for ADHD, and also fits this mix well at the 10mg ER dose rather than the 15mg dose. I feel alive, aware, normal, active and can focus. Be careful about taking ANY of these in high doses! I plan on weaning to lower dosage on all 3 within 2 months. My aim is to be chemical free sometime next year, or the BARE MINIMUM of what I need. I managed 45 years without Prozac or Dex, and have moved up the ranks in almost all jobs I had.

{"Drug name": "Prozac oral", "long description": "Prozac was perscribed as a secondary drug to Wellbutrin, when increasing it gave me stomach  and chest pain. I was being treated for panic attachs, insominia, anxiety, along with depression. Prozac worked fast for me and I would feel happy for hours afterwards. This enabled me to get things done that would take me forever. I became the energizer bunny, unfortunatly when I changed medical insurance my new doctor told me that Prozac was an old drug and would only give me Wellbutrin after that. Now I am back to being in the middle, no ups or downs now. But I still have problems with anxiety and sleeplessness."},
{"Drug name": "Prozac oral", "long description": "I started getting panic attacks when I was a very little kid (I can remember having them as young as age 7).  Finally, at age 40, I gave up trying to \"be macho\" about it and went to see a psychiatrist.  This was very difficult for me because I always related \"psychiatrist\" with \"inability to cope\" and I've always prided myself on being able to deal with anything (even managing my panic attacks for 30+ years).  The reality is, I wasn't really dealing with panic as much as I would just avoid putting myself in situations that might cause panic.  (Those of us that suffer from general panic disorder know that's not easy--sometimes it comes out of nowhere!)  I finally got sick and tired of always having \"will this cause a panic attack?\" in the back of my mind.  I've been on 20mg for three years now.  WOW!  What a difference!  It absolutely has changed my life!  It's so nice to feel normal (i.e. \"panic free\") even in stressful situations.  I'm so thankful for this drug!  I'm just mad that I spent many years equating \"seeking help\" with \"weakness\" or \"going crazy/can't deal with things\".  I'm perfectly sane and rational--my body just chemically did strange things.  Not anymore!  Prozac made a world of difference for me."},

Had a strong craving for sweets, I practically only ate Twizzlers, and lost a significant amount of weight.

I ahve now come off the medication (under supervision) and it has taken over one and a half years, with some pretty nasty withdrawal symptoms.

I am not suggesting people stop taking prozac just that they are monitored while on the drug, it is a very good drug for some people but not so great for others like most medication. Don't think that just because you have been on it for a long time you will not be affected by the side effects. Have your Dr monitor you on a regular basis."},

He was surprised to hear it had worked best for me of everything I'd ever taken. I've been on it for about a year not.

{"Drug name": "Prozac oral", "long description": "After 3 years of battling depression, I found something that works for me. Okay, it's not a cure, I still have anxiety and symptoms of depression. But after about a month of taking Prozac (and hydroxyzine as needed for anxiety) I have the urge to get off my lazy you know what and actually do something instead of sleeping every day away. I still feel sad a lot, I still have suicidal thoughts (no intentions though), and I still suffer from my generalized anxiety disorder. But on a scale of 1-10 10 being the worst, I was a 10. This has brought it down to a 6. I took Prozac before and it didn't seem to do much so then I switched to Effexor 75mg per day, then I switched to 50mg of Zoloft, then I went to a combo of 20mg of Lexapro and 150mg of Wellbutrin. I wanted to try Prozac again and instead of starting at 10mg for the first week then going to 20, I started at 20 and went to 40. Effexor, Zoloft, Lexapro, and Wellbutrin were prescribed from a psychiatrist as well was the first run with Prozac. So after 2 months being off the Lexapro and Wellbutrin combo, I talked to my regular doctor and she gladly prescribed Prozac and just increased the dose. It's ridiculous how the psychiatrist had my brain switching from med to med when all I needed was a simple increase in my Prozac. And another thing, you hear so much negative, but there is positive to Prozac. For some it can destroy a family, and for others it may rebuild one. "},
{"Drug name": "Prozac oral", "long description": "I have panic attacks out of nowhere, and they started when I was 16, I also took Adderall XR (would have panic attacks with or without the Adderall). I was first given Paxil and I hated that crap. I felt all zombie-ish. Not to mention the horrible withdrawal, excuse me, discontinuation syndrome.  So I stopped antidepressants for about two years, until I was 19 in community college and was having bad agoraphobia. I stopped Adderall and everything. So I went to a shrink and she brought me to a reasonable dose of Adderall and then 5 mg Prozac for a week, 10 for another week, then 20 mg. I felt okay, like panic attacks had receded a little bit. However, I still had them regardless. So, we bumped up Prozac to 30 mg, added on Klonopin (0-2 mg) as needed for days I feel keyed up. I tried the combo of Adderall XR, Prozac, and Klonopin. It worked great. I still have the occasional breakthrough panic attack but she prescribed 0-2 mg Xanax depending on severity.    Overall the combo for ADHD, anxiety, and panic disorder has worked well. Plus tablet splitting saves money with the Xanax and Klonopin.    **NOTE: A work on Xanax and Klonopin, I do NOT take these every single day. Xanax is for the panic that breaks through suddenly and I usually take 1 mg. The Klonopin is if I am feeling a bit too \"keyed-up\" or anxious in the morning, noon, or evening. Klonopin comes on more subtlety than Xanax, which is like a wipe-out of total panic.    This combination works great!"},

It took me awhile to figure out that I needed to take the Brand name because I got bad side effects/less effective when I switched to Generic, but now I've been back on the brand name and its a dramatic difference. My depression is so much better and I feel like a cloud has lifted. Everything is pretty much better, but I still have my ups and downs. No pill is a \"miracle.\" I may need to up my dose when I see my psychiatrist next week because I've recently been having a more difficult time coping w/my life. However, overall, this med is a great choice for me. Only side effects: stomach discomfort/indigestion intermittently, and hyperactivity (but that is much preferred to my anxiety & depression). Thank you Prozac! I do believe antidepressants are overprescribed, but for me it is a necessity. I've learned the hard way that I decompensate without an antidepressant. Prozac is the one that has really worked for me. Oh, and in case you are wondering, it actually has NOT badly impacted my sex drive! I am still very much active w/my fiance;) So SSRIs don't always have a bad effect on your libido. Give it a try! It may work for you!"},

{"Drug name": "Prozac oral", "long description": "For a teenager with OCD concerning harm, sexuality, and religion, like me, this is an excellent medication. Previously I took Zoloft, which made my associated depression significantly worse. This medicine does a great job of reducing obsessive thoughts and compulsive urges. I would say overall that my OCD is at about 25% of the untreated (freaking out constantly) level. Even when I am faced with obsessions or anxiety, they are much easier to deal with. Overall, I would say that it doesn't have some of the typical anti-depressant side-effects, like weight gain, sleepiness, or emotional indifference. There are some side-effects, however. At 60 mg it can cause hyperactivity and sleep disturbances, like waking up at inconvenient times and very vivid dreams. For these reasons, I am thinking about going back down to 40 mg later. "},

{"Drug name": "Prozac oral", "long description": "First, I would like to say that it is crucial to find the right medicine for you by working with a doctor you trust. Prozac works for me, but may not work for you. Don't give up, and most importantly, don't wait to get help. Make an appointment as soon as you have questions or concerns about your mind and/or body.    For me, personally, Prozac has been great. I suffered from depression during most of my twenties, but was resistant to taking medicine. I was worried about side effects. I tried Zoloft, which did not work for me - made me jittery (which might have been the dosage, or just the med). I've also taken ADD meds for ADD and had symptoms of paranoia with the two that I tried on separate occasions. I find that the Prozac helps a little with ADD. I've come to just accept my ADD also - I felt like a different person when I was medicated for it.    Prozac has helped my depression significantly. I don't have major side effects. I have had weight gain, but I don't know if I can blame the medicine. It is harder to achieve an orgasm (I'm a woman) but I can still get there. The sexual side effects have been frustrating sometimes, but I wouldn't trade the feelings of well being I have when I take my 20 mg day as prescribed(I went off of it once cold turkey and the depression came back).    Again, hang in there, best wishes, and find a doctor who listens to you and is knowledgeable in their field.     "},
{"Drug name": "Prozac oral", "long description": "I take Prozac for PMDD (pre menstrual disphoric disorder).  Have been on it fofr 2 years now.  It absolutely works for PMDD & I have been symptom free for 2 years.  When I first started for the 1st two weeks I had an unusually high amount of energy & was extremely happy.  Then things went back to normal with out the PMDD.  I once went through a small depression with a personal relationship & asked my doctor to higher it from the minimal dose of 20 mil.  He upped it to 40 mil & after a few weeks I kept feeling weird all the time with 'zaps'.  If you don't know what zaps are it's hard to explain- but it feels like your brain is being electrified by tiny little electrical circuits & is really annoying & a little painful but most of all distracting to everyday functions & life.  So I went back down to my 20 mil & have been there ever since.  I can honestly say that it changed my life because PMDD no longer controls my emotions and life- I do.  I still have emotions like every one else, a sex drive, orgasms, happiness & sadness.  I just don't have PMDD what so ever anymore & that alone has changed & saved my life!  I strongly recommend for PMDD!"},

I use to have confidence in myself and be fairly normal.  Now I question everything.  My advice is don\u00b4t touch this stuff.  It is psychologically addictive and physically addictive and if you ever decide you want to get off it can be too late as it has made your anxiety go through the roof, your depression worsen, and you are now completely physically addicted.  Taking drugs to cope with life is not natural and just because a doctor perscribes it and they say it is meant to treat a certain condition doesn\u00b4t mean you are not taking a drug and falling into the escapism and perils of taking any other drug.  Once cocaine was considered the miracle drug until it became clear what it did to people.  I think Doctors who perscribe anti depressants are incompetant and I think the pharmaseutical industry is a billion dollar industry focused on making billions no matter what the human cost.

I was told that I had serum sickness and I was allergic to fluoxetine. I have had serum sickness once before in my life from penicillin antibiotics. Anybody who has ever had serum sickness (even to a drug totally unrelated) should never take a drug that has caused serum sickness before.

It helps me to get out of bed daily and to keep my sense of humor. However, the residual depression I've had to go to therapy for to help it go away. Unfortunately, there is no such thing as a magic pill! "},
{"Drug name": "Prozac oral", "long description": "I started taking prozac for Anxiety and Depression and it works wonders for me. Within two weeks, I noticed a slowing of my rushing thoughts and I stopped having nightmares. I've been sleeping better and my social anxiety is gone as well. I'm able to function and not panic when I know there's going to be people- of course, I still don't like to be in groups but my anxiety doesn't act up.      The only quips I have with it are that I don't have an appetite. Which is fine, I never had much of one anyway. And very slight nausea as my body adjusted to the medication.     With the type of drug this is, of course, you'll have a bit of apathy. It made me a little quieter and sometimes I'm content to just stare at things, but it's by no means my constant feeling on this medicine. I've got nothing but really good things to say about this insofar.    Also- before I was constantly tired, now I have more energy not to a hyper extent, but I'm not really sleepy during the day. I feel closer to my self than I have in years."},

I cannot cry whilst on it, and cannot grieve when I go through pain or trauma.     While off the drug I noticed all my suppressed and undealt with trauma surfaced, and I was finally able to grieve and cry which was a relief.  I have had an incredible six years of hardship in my life but the prozac suppressed my ability to deal with it.  It internalised instead and has made my psoiasis and athritis and general immune system worse.  I gained an enormous amount of weight very quickly when off the drug due to uncontrollable binge eating, and if I had continued I would have died of ruptured stomach or coma.  I know this for a fact as in my youth, before prozac, I went to A&E a few times to evacuate my stomach or else I would have died.  I cannot have a sex life because of the prozac; it makes my vagina dry and cannot orgasm or enjoy anything, so I am very lonely and unfulfilled and have no partner.  This is the price I have to pay for not eating myself into a coma or going insane with ocd and tics.  I guess you could say it is an effective drug in that sense."},

History included multiple brain trauma (football), leading to major depressive episodes and suicide attempts in early 20's. I experienced relief of primary symptoms within 30min of administering the med, which everyone says is impossible (similar reaction in other family members). Increased concentration, alleviation of depressive symptoms etc. was amazing.  Remember not every drug in this family is the same nor are off label meds. Fluoxitine (Prozac) gave me great help until it just gave out on me after ~5 yrs (apparently the MDs call this pooping out) Other SSRIs were not the same (as of course they have different shapes) and I am certain their neurological function is not the same and remains very poorly understood (no matter what your MD pretends - this is a very imprecise practice) Bottom line, Prozac for me was amazing, other SSRIs I have taken I would say range from ineffective to VERY DANGEROUS.  Be careful what MDs perscribe, stick to brand names, and don't be afraid to talk to your DR about discontinuing meds that make you sick (side effects happen, but finding a good Dr is much much harder than finding a Dr. who will use shotgun Tx trying each one of of these medications hoping to get it right).  Try to Find an MD who has seen lots of people like you, the chance their experience will transform your care is much much higher. Many of these SSRIs are being promoted to General Practitioners who have no business treating psychiatric patients with strong and potentially dangerous meds.

In the first year, we altered the dosage to get it right, and I've cut back once (didn't work) and upped the dosage once (weird side effects.) So now I'm at 40 mg on which I feel \"normal\" with minimal depressive episodes.  On doctor's suggestion I tried adding Wellbutrin to see if my libido would return, and it did.....BUT, after a few weeks Wellbutrin stopped helping my libido at all, so I just stayed with Prozac alone.  Though I have concerns about staying on it this long, I don't function well at all without it, AND it works so well, I feel so well, that I plan to keep taking it.  Healthy diet (gluten-free) has also helped with the overall effectiveness of Prozac for me.   "},

I just kept getting worse and worse and worse until I kinda lost it and got exchanged to Zoloft, haven\u2019t been on Zoloft long enough to truly know if it\u2019s helped or not though.\n\nOtherwise, if you\u2019re a doctor make sure you get a full run down of your patient before prescribing anything.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re a patient, make sure you let your doctor know everything about your mental and physical health so you don\u2019t get misdiagnosed. (If you\u2019ve done other drugs or alcohol, let them know! If you\u2019re seeing things, or having bouts of extreme happiness, let them know!

{"Drug name": "Prozac oral", "long description": "I've tried many AD's including other anxiety medications, and I can say the Prozac is one of the best. It's not without challenges. You will have jittery feelings, bouts of anxiety and other weird symptoms when you first start it. But if you tell yourself it's the body getting acclimated to the medication, combined with exercise, meditation and taking warm baths or showers, you will eventually notice how effective this medication is when it comes to neutralizing panic disorder or anxiety.   All have weight gain issues, except Wellbutrin and a few others. But these drugs wire you and IMHO do not treat anxiety efficiently. Zoloft and Wellbutrin were the worst. They seem to be effective at the beginning, but as your body gets used to them, the nervousness, difficulty sleeping and jitters will come back  To combat weight gain, the two most effective strategies are low carb diets and or intermittent fasting. Try going for 8 hours, then 10 hours and then 12-14 hours if you can. Your weight gain will completely be neutralized. Your energy levels will help counteract the drowsiness Prozac can give you. This combined with exercise daily or at least 3 times a week will change your life  Prozac is by far the most effective treatment. I took half of the prescribed dose (one 10mg pill every other day) to allow a slow introduction. If it's too powerful for you, you can ask your doctor or pharmacist to give it to you in a tablet form. This way you can break it in half and take 5mg daily or every other day.   I didn't have my first panic attack until the age of 38. I had multiple visits to Urgent Care and visited other specialists like a Pulmonologist and heart doctor because I thought I was either having a heart attack, or my lungs were about to collapse. The anxiety was so bad, that it effected my breathing. Not shortness of breath, but when exhaling, it felt as if my lungs were trying to collapse. When I tried to sleep, it felt like I had to physically and consciously intervene with my breathing so that my lungs wouldn't collapse. I know it sounds crazy. It is one of the most humbling and terrifying feelings I've ever gone through and I will never ever question someone or mock someone when they tell me they suffer with anxiety. You have no control over it and it will rear it's ugly head when you're not expecting it. I hope this helps someone. Just know, that the jitters, restlessness and worry will subside when you first take it. It takes a few weeks for the body to get used to it and for the chemicals in the brain to stabilize.   I know a few people that have taken Prozac for 6 months to a year, stopped it to take a break and then start up again when the chemicals in the brain get too low. It's really personal preference and you can talk to your doctor or psych to strategize"},

My first day on Prozac I ended up calling 911, cause I thought I was having a heart attack, but it ended up being my first panic attack along with the taste of burning plastic in my mouth and strange thoughts (disturbing thoughts)..

They ask you to talk to your doctor about additional side-effects.. Thats crazy.. I recall the side-effects list being a lot longer back in the day.. And they aren't pretty..

{"Drug name": "fluoxetine oral", "long description": "After having been on zoloft for almost 3 years with excellent results, it pooped out on me and stopped working. My doctor decided to first max out my zoloft dosage to see if that would help. It somewhat did, but not to out satisfaction and it made me very sedated. We then decided to switch me to prozac as it is the most stimulating and i was looking for something to give me energy. Over several weeks, i weened myself off of the 200mg a day zoloft (down 50mg a week) and up to 60mg proac (20 mg per week until 60mg). The transition period was tough. I was unable to distinguish if the side effects were from discontinuing the zoloft or beginning the proac. By the time I stopped taking the zoloft, I was on 60mg prozac/day. I was irritable, anxious, and unable to have a full night's sleep. I would wake up every 1-2 hours. I also have ativan to take when needed and it surely helped with the sleeping and daily panic attacks. after several weeks, I thought that the prozac was beginning to work. However, I was wrong. I had severe side effects that would not go away. Mainly, joint pain, irritability, lack of motivation and concentration. I also noticed bruises on the inside of my thighs that came out of nowhere. I went back to my doctor and we lowered my dose to 40mg/day. a week later, after having the same side effects on top of fever, night sweats, and just did not feel right. I called my doc and she recommended i go to the ER to rule out neuroleptic malignant sydrome (later found out that is caused by antipsychotics, NOT antidepressants). we decided to end the prozac as it was clearly not working right with my body. I am beginning 10mg of lexapro tomorrow and am trying to be optimistic. I had great success with zoloft until it pooped out and am really hoping that the lexapro will work just as good as the zoloft. I know everyone's mind and body reacts differently, but for me the prozac was a failure. Just work closely wit your doctor, you know your body. Peace to all :)"}
